        <h4>As a beginner, how much weight should I lift?</h4>
        The best thing you can do is start at the lower end of the weight spectrum and work your way up until you reach about 60 to 70% of your max limit (the most amount of weight you can lift for one repetition with good form). That will give you a rough idea of what to start on, allowing you to slowly increase the weight little by little every week.
        
        <h4>What are reps and sets?</h4>
        Reps: a rep is how many times you repeat a specific exercise
    
        Sets: a set is how many rounds of reps you do.
        
        So if you lift 10 times on a bench press, that would be one set of 10 reps. If you took a short break and then did the same again, youll have completed two sets of 10 reps.
        
        How many reps and sets you go for depends on what youre trying to achieve. More reps at a lower weight would improve your endurance, while fewer reps at a higher weight would build your muscle mass.
        
        When it comes to sets, people usually aim for between three to five, depending on how many you can complete without compromising your form.</p>

            This workout for females is designed to tone the whole body, with a slight emphasis on the legs and glutes (bottom). Its a myth that women will become bulky if they lift weights.
